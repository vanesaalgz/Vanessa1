        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Vanessa Alvarado, and I am a Digital Designer</p>
            <p>My journey into the world of digital design began with a simple fascination for colors, shapes, and the endless possibilities they offered. As a child, I would spend hours sketching and experimenting with different patterns, completely unaware that this hobby one day become my profession. Over the years I honed my skills, diving deep into realms pf graphic design, user experience, and digital illustration. Today, I transform ideas into visually compelling stories, driven by a passion that has only grown stronger with time. Wheter it's crafting sleek interfaces or vibrant visuals, my goal is to create designs that not only catch the eye but also connect with the heart.</p>
